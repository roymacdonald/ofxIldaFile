ofxIldaFile
=====================================

openFrameworks addon for reading and writing ilda (.ild) files 
 
### STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
 
.ild files are used in some ILDA laser projectors. These files usually go in an SD card in the projector which reads these and plays back. This addon is for creating and reading this kind of files.
 
[Ilda file specification](https://www.ilda.com/resources/StandardsDocs/ILDA_IDTF14_rev011.pdf)

I took the code from [this](https://github.com/avilleret/laser_drawer) project as a starting point.
